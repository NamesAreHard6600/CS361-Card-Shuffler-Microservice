For which teammate did you implement “Microservice A”?
Zachary Sherman

What is the current status of the microservice? Hopefully, it’s done!
Finished

If the microservice isn’t done, which parts aren’t done and when will they be done?
N/A

How is your teammate going to access your microservice? Should they get your code from GitHub (if so, provide a link to your public or private repo)? Should they run your code locally? Is your microservice hosted somewhere? Etc.
Download the code directly from GitHub, or download the reduced version (excludes unnecessary files) from the releases page. The code should then be run locally, in your project folder in a separate terminal.
Release Page: https://github.com/NamesAreHard6600/CS361-Card-Shuffler-Microservice/releases/tag/1.0.0
Main: https://github.com/NamesAreHard6600/CS361-Card-Shuffler-Microservice/tree/main

If your teammate cannot access/call YOUR microservice, what should they do? Can you be available to help them? What’s your availability?
Ping me on discord, and we can work it out through text or on a voice call if necessary. My availability is unstable due to vacation, so we'll have to work it out per day.

If your teammate cannot access/call your microservice, by when do they need to tell you? Provide a specific date to ensure they have a clear deadline.
Preferably, please give me at least 48 hours before the deadline (before the end of 8/9/2025). I will also however follow our preset ground rules and respond within 6 hours of a ping, but may not be able to access a computer to help beyond messaging without more warning.

Is there anything else your teammate needs to know? Anything you’re worried about? Any assumptions you’re making? Any other mitigations / backup plans you want to mention or want to discuss with your teammate?
We've already discussed everything you need to know on discord, and you've gotten to confirm it looks good.
